Pat the beef dry and toss it with the flour until coated. Shake off any excess flour.\\n\\n2. Heat the olive oil in a large pot or dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the beef in a single layer and brown on all sides, about 2-3 minutes per side. Transfer browned beef to a plate. \\n\\n3. Add the onions to the pot and cook for 2-3 minutes until translucent. Add the carrots and potatoes and cook for 2 more minutes.\\n\\n4. Pour in the beef broth and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Add the bay leaf, thyme, salt and pepper. \\n\\n5. Return the beef and any juices to the pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Simmer for 1-1.5 hours until beef is very tender. \\n\\n6. Remove bay leaf. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed before serving.\\n\\nThat's it! Let the stew simmer low and slow for that fall-apart tender beef. Serve hot with crusty bread. Enjoy!\")"

This Authorised Dealer Manual must be \\nread in conjunction with the Regulations and Authorised Dealers may transact without \\nreference to the Financial Surveillance Department, provided such transactions are \\npermitted in terms of this Authorised Dealer Manual. \\n \\nThe arrangements set out in the Authorised Dealer Manual  should in no manner be \\nconstrued as absolving Authorised Dealers , their clients and associated entities from  \\ntheir duties and obligations under any other law, including but not limited to the \\nPrevention of Organised Crime Act, 1998 (Act No. 121 of 1998), the Financial \\nIntelligence Centre Act, 2001 (Act No. 38 of 2001) and the Protection of Constitutional \\nDemocracy against Terrorist and Related Activities Act, 2004 (Act No. 33 of 2004). \\n \\nThe Financial Surveillance Department views contraventions of the Exchange Control \\nRegulations, as well as any actions to circumvent the permissions and conditions \\ncontained in the Authorised Dealer Manual, in a very serious light. \\n \\nThe Financial Surveillance Department reserves the right to amend, grant or impose \\nadditional permissions or conditions, with new or amended permissions or conditions \\nwhich will be communicated by the Financial Surveillance Department on its website.  \\n \\nIn instances where an Authorised Dealer is not in a position to buy, borrow, sell or lend \\nforeign currency in terms of the permissions and conditions set out in the Authorised \\nDealer Manual, an official application with full details applicable to the request must be \\nsubmitted to the Financial Surveillance Department. \\n \\nFor the benefit of the general public, Currency and Exchanges guidelines for business \\nentities and Currency and Exchanges guidelines for individuals have been published \\nby the Financial Surveillance Department . These guidelines set out, in less technical \\nterms, the permissions and conditions relating to cross-border foreign transactions. \\n \\nThe Authorised Dealer Manual, ADLA Manual, Currency and Exchanges guidelines for \\nbusiness entities, Currency and Exchanges guidelines for individuals and applicable \\namendments thereto are available on the South African Reserve Bank’s website: \\nwww.resbank.co.za. \\n \\n \\n--oOo-- ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

This \\nprinciple ensures the consistent classification of foreign \\nexposure, whether acquired directly in foreign currency or \\nindirectly through a domestic intermediary. For instance, a \\npension fund holding foreign equities through a collective \\ninvestment scheme registered locally should record such an \\ninvestment as a Rand denominated foreign asset. \\n \\n(dd) Managing institutions that manage assets on behalf of other \\ninstitutional investors are required to report the asset \\nallocation of such funds or policies to the originating institution \\nas at the end of each calendar quarter within 15 working days \\nof each calendar quarter end.

It helps the policyholder to make \\nfinancial provision for the policyholder and the latter’s depend ants. \\nIt also provides a medium of saving and investment on a systematic \\nlong-term basis. Most policies combine these aspects of life \\ninsurance, the protection element and the savings element, to a \\ngreater or lesser degree. \\n \\n(xiii) Marine insurance \\n \\n(a) Marine insurance is a contract which indemnifies the insured \\nagainst: \\n \\n(aa) loss of or damage to any vessel; \\n \\n(bb) loss of or damage to goods during their conveyance by water \\nor while being stored, handled or treated in connection with \\nsuch conveyance; \\n \\n(cc) loss of freight for any such conveyance; and \\n \\n(dd) any other loss in connection with any such vessel or goods or \\nfreight against which an insurance may lawfully be effected. \\n \\n(b) Goods conveyed on land  or air , although interstate, shall not be \\nregarded as a marine policy and will therefore not qualify for \\npurposes of subsection (E)(ii)(d) below. \\n \\n(xiv) Professional reinsurers \\n \\n(a) Professional reinsurers confine their activities to reinsurance and do \\nnot undertake direct underwriting. \\n \\n(xv) Reinsurer \\n \\n(a) A reinsurer is a party to an insurance contract with an insurer. \\n \\n(b) Under a reinsurance contract the reinsurer accepts all or a certain \\nshare of the insurance or insurances underwritten by the insurer in \\nreturn for a certain share of the premium.

The transaction is accompanied by a pledge from the \\nborrower to the lender to reverse the transaction at a future date by \\nthe redelivery of equivalent locally quoted securities. Collateral is \\nusually required by lenders to cover the counter party risk involved \\nin securities lending. Loans of locally quoted securities can be made \\neither on a fixed term or on an open -ended (or call) basis. Open -\\nended loans will continue until either the lender or the borrower \\ndecides to terminate the loan. In both cases, on termination, the \\nlender will ordinarily receive back from the borrower locally quoted \\nsecurities of a similar kind to those lent and in exchange the lender \\nwill return the borrower’s collateral. For the period of the loan the \\nlender retains all the rights attached to the locally quoted securities \\nlent, except the right to vote. Thus all dividends and corporate action \\nentitlements pass back to the lender through the borrower. \\n \\n(b) Securities lending transactions entered into with a non -resident \\ncounter party are deemed to be either a form of financial assistance ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",
